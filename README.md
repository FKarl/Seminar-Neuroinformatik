Some code to visualize differences between different clustering algorithms.

## Content

### Create data sets

* In [scripts/create_smiley.py](./scripts/create_smiley.py) a data set in the shape of a smiley face can be created.
* In [scripts/create_random_cluster.py](./scripts/create_random_cluster.py) a data set with random centroids can be
  created.

### Visualize data sets

* In [scripts/visualize_clustering.py](./scripts/visualize_clustering.py) the data set can be clustered using different
  clustering algorithms and the results can be visualized.
* The different visualization options are:
    * Without clustering
    * KMeans
    * KMeans with centroids
    * DBSCAN

### Examples

* In [example_results](./example_results) a selection of example results can be found.

## Motivation

This code was created during my neuroinformatics seminar at the University of Ulm.
